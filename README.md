In this project, two main recommendation system techines are implemented and compared with a baseline model. I compared SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) solution with the Restricted Boltzmann Machine method. It is fascinating to see that a linear algebra method can perform close to a neural network method. These methods outperform popularity baseline model. Below, two sources that helped me in this project.
